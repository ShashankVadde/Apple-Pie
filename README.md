# Apple-Pie
Created a word guessing game for the iPad using Swift as part of the Develop in Swift Fundamentals course. In this game, players have a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word, and each incorrect guess causes an apple to fall from a tree. The player wins if they guess the word before all the apples are gone.
